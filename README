# bootstrap.sh

Meant to install useful binaries (`bootstrap/homebrew.sh`) on a new machine, some required for dotfiles. Also executes `bootstrap/mac_defaults.sh`, which sets Mac system configuration up better using `defaults write`.

After bootstrap.sh has finished,  run `chsh -s $(which zsh)` to set the user shell to zsh. If `chsh` displays `chsh:/usr/local/bin/zsh: non-standard shell`, that's an error. It means that `chsh` will only accept shells that are defined in the file `/etc/shells`. Add `/usr/local/bin/zsh` to `/etc/shells`:
`sudo echo "$(which zsh)" >> /etc/shells` and then run `chsh -s $(which zsh)` again.

**A restart is required for some of the changes to take affect.**

### Other Tasks for a New Machine

Install applications and their settings/extensions:

* iTerm 2
* Moom
* Alfred
* Chrome
* VirtualBox & Vagrant
* Google Drive
* Adobe CS6 Suite
    - Photoshop: import exported presets, Nik Software
* Photo Mechanic
    - IPTC Stationery Pad, keywords hierarchy export, sync preferences
* PhpStorm
    - import exported settings


# install.sh

Installs dotfile config or updates symlinks using DotBot.

# Submodule Pains

If when running `install.sh` an `error: pathspec 'dotbot' did not match any file(s) known to git` error is thrown, but the 'dotbot' files still exist, rerun `git submodule add git@github.com:anishathalye/dotfiles.git` so git reports `Adding existing repo at 'dotbot' to the index`.

Vim uses Vundle as a plugin manager. If after running `git add .`, a `warning: adding embedded git repository: vim/bundle/ctrlp.vim`, do the following:

```
git reset HEAD // unstage all commits

// get the url to add as a submodule
git config --get remote.origin.url

// use URL from above and the path from the warning message
// should see 'Adding existing repo at 'vim/bundle/ctrlp.vim' to the index'
git submodule add https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim.git vim/bundle/ctrlp.vim

// now find added submodule repo and add ignore = untracked
vim .gitmodules

[submodule "vim/bundle/ctrlp.vim"]
	path = vim/bundle/ctrlp.vim
	url = https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim.git
	ignore = untracked
```

If any Vim plugins are added and are listed in `Untracked Files:`, run following steps above by `cd`ing into the path and getting the remote URL. Must manually add all plugin repos as submodules.
